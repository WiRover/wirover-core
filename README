===================
1   Introduction
===================

This is the user-level implementation of WiRover.  The WiRover
architecture comprises two main components -- the gateway and the
controller. It also includes a root server that handles mapping
gateways to controllers.

The mobile platform with one or more managed interfaces is the gateway.
Typically, the gateway is a mobile WiFi access point with multiple
cellular interfaces, hence the name gateway.

The other component, the controller, is a tunnel endpoint for the
traffic sent through the gateway.  Tunneling is used to implement
reliable handover and performance enhancements. Typically, a controller
will reside in a fixed location with a well-provisioned network and will
provide service to many gateways.

===================
2   Source Code
===================
    
	src/policy
	src/wiroot
    src/wigateway
    src/wicontroller
    src/common

The source code is divided into several directories.  The wi*
subdirectories are specific to their respective components. The 
common subdirectory contains some shared code and header files.
The policy directory contains code related the vpolicy command
and its interactions with the core WiRover code.

===================
3   Installation
===================

On a standard version of Ubuntu, the following commands will
install all the dependencies:

sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install make
sudo apt-get install libconfig-dev
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev 
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev 
sudo apt-get install libgps-dev
export CXX=g++

To compile the code run "cmake ." in the src directory. This will generate
the make files for all the components. Running make in the src/ directory
will compile all components. Alternative make can be run in a subdirectory
to compile a single component.

The wi* components require a configuration file. A default is located in the
subdirectory and can be installed to /etc/ on production systems. The controller
and root server also require a database. These can be installed from our "dbupdate"
tool.

===================
4   Usage
===================

For the gateway, it is most important to specify the IP address of the
root server to which you will be connecting and the interfaces you want
to allow or disallow. This can be done in the wigateway.conf file.

For the controller, you will also need to specify the root server that
the controller will connect to.

Once the configuration is done, it is sufficient to run wigateway or
wicontroller from the command line as root.  You can also configure the
system to start either on startup.  The exact method to do this varies
from distribution to distribution, but an almost universal way is to
add "wigateway &" or "wicontroller &" to /etc/rc.local.
