# Lines starting with '#' will be ignored

# Link priority groups.  WiGateway will only use links from one group at a
# time, and it will choose the highest level group possible.  If a higher level
# link becomes available, all new flows will be mapped to the higher level
# link, and optionally, all existing flows will be remapped.  Negative priority
# links are never used.  The default priority level is zero, so it is not
# necessary to define explicity the list of level zero links.
PRIORITY:-1    lo,pan0,wmaster0,wmaster1,eth0,wifi0,wifi1,tun0,mon.wlan0
